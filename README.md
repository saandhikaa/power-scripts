## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup on Windows

This script collection works best with **PowerShell 7+**. Follow these steps to get started:
<br/>

#### 1. Install PowerShell 7

If you're still using Windows PowerShell 5.1, it's strongly recommended to upgrade to PowerShell 7 for better performance and compatibility.

- Visit the official GitHub releases page [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest).

- Scroll down to the "Assets" section.

- Download the appropriate installer for your system: `PowerShell-<version>-win-x64.msi`
Example: `PowerShell-7.4.1-win-x64.msi`

- Open the .msi file to start the installation and follow the setup wizard.

Once installed, **open PowerShell 7** (you can find it as `PowerShell 7` in your Start Menu or run `pwsh` from any terminal).
<br/>

#### 2. Clone This Repository to Your PowerShell Folder

Inside your new PowerShell 7 terminal, run:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/saandhikaa/power-scripts.git "$HOME\Documents\PowerShell"
```
<br/>

#### 3. Add Script Folder to PATH

To use your scripts globally (from any folder), run:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $env:PATH + ";$HOME\Documents\PowerShell\Scripts", "User")
```

Then restart your terminal.
<br/>

#### 4. Allow Scripts to Run

If this is your first time running custom PowerShell scripts, you may need to allow it:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

When prompted, type `Y` to confirm.
<br/>

#### 5. You‚Äôre Ready!

Try this one:

```powershell
hello
```
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## üì¶ External Tools

Some scripts rely on external tools stored in the `Library/` directory:

| Tool     | Path                            | GitHub / Source Link                                  |
|----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `yt-dlp` | `Library/ytdlp/yt-dlp.exe`      | [github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) |
| `ffmpeg` | `Library/ytdlp/ffmpeg.exe`      | [github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) |

These tools are downloaded and maintained automatically if missing. They are excluded from Git tracking.
